# Buildman

Buildman is game where there is an unknown word and the player has to guess the word before the chracter is built. The player can first guess letters, before guessing the word entirely. 

## How to use the application

The game first starts by prompting the player with which difficulty they want to play with. The higher the difficulty, the less guesses the player has and words get harder. After choosing a difficulty, the player has the chance to choose which theme to play. There are two themes at the moment, winter and jungle. The unknown word, character, and baackground are all themed. This can help to guess the unknown word. Another option are custom words, found in the theme menu. The player has the ability to add their own words to an already existing file or create a themed file themselves. **Remember to press enter after every word. If the player simply wants to play an already existing file, they can just choose a file name and press play. After every game, the player can choose to either exit or play again.
